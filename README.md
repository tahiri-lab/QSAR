# üìù About the project

`QSAR` is a Python package that offers robust predictive modeling using QSAR for evaluating the transfer of
environmental contaminants in breast milk. Developed by the dedicated team led by
Professor [Nadia Tahiri](https://tahirinadia.github.io/) at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada. This
open-source integrates multiple predictive models, provides synthetic data generation via GANs, and is tailored for
researchers and health professionals.

<a id="installation"></a>

# ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) is used to handle the environment
dependencies.

Once ```miniconda``` is installed, the environment can be created and activated with the following commands:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate qsar_env
```

‚ö†Ô∏è We currently only support Python 3.10 due to some dependencies that are not yet compatible with Python 3.11+. We will
update the package as soon as the dependencies are updated.

<a id="use-cases"></a>

# üöÄ Use cases

The `QSAR` package can be encapsulated in other applications or used as a standalone package.
You can refer to the tutorials on how to use the package functionalities, or use the package as a standalone application
by running the following command:

```bash
python main.py --config <config_file> --output <output_dir>
```

where ```<config_file>``` is the path to the `YAML` configuration file and ```<output_dir>``` is the path to the output
directory.

Both arguments are optional. If not provided, the default values are ```config/compare_all_models.yaml```
and ```results/```, respectively.

To do a quick test, you can run the package with only one model by running the following command:

```bash
python main.py --config ridge.yaml --output results/
```

We can also generate synthetic data using GANs by including the ```gan``` flag in the configuration file.
You can explore examples of the different options provided by the package in the ```config/``` folders.

# üìö Tutorials

We provide several tutorials to help you get started with the package. You can find them in the ```tutorials/``` folder.
You can explore the ```tutorials/models/```, ```tutorials/gan/```, and ```tutorials/preprocessing/``` folders to learn
more about the different functionalities of the package.

# üìñ Documentation

You can also refer to the [documentation](https://tahiri-lab.github.io/QSAR/) for more details.

We generated the documentation using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). To generate the documentation
locally, you can run the following command:

```bash
cd docs/
make html
```

The documentation will be generated in the ```docs/build/html/``` folder. You can open the ```index.html``` file in your
browser to view the documentation.
