# üìù About the project

`QSAR` is a Python package that offers robust predictive modeling using QSAR for evaluating the transfer of environmental contaminants in breast milk. Developed by the dedicated team led by Professor [Nadia Tahiri](https://tahirinadia.github.io/) at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada. This open-source integrates multiple predictive models, provides synthetic data generation via GANs, and is tailored for researchers and health professionals.

<a id="installation"></a>
# ‚öíÔ∏è Installation
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) is used to handle the environment dependencies.

Once ```miniconda``` is installed, the environment can be created and activated with the following commands:
```bash
conda create --name <env_name> python=3.10
conda activate <env_name>
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

‚ö†Ô∏è We currently only support Python 3.10 due to some dependencies that are not yet compatible with Python 3.11+. We will update the package as soon as the dependencies are updated.

<a id="use-cases"></a>
# üöÄ Use cases
The `QSAR` package can be encapsulated in other applications or used as a standalone package. 
You can refer to the tutorials on how to use the package functionalities, or use the package as a standalone application by running the following command:
```bash
python main.py --config <config_file> --output <output_dir>
```
where ```<config_file>``` is the path to the `YAML` configuration file and ```<output_dir>``` is the path to the output directory.

You can also refer to the [documentation](https://tahiri-lab.github.io/QSAR/) for more details.
